# Database Normalization - ALX Airbnb Database

## âœ… What is Normalization?

Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity. The goal is to structure the tables and their relationships to reduce duplication and ensure consistency.

## âœ… Normalization Process to 3NF

### ðŸ”¹ First Normal Form (1NF)

- **Rule:** Eliminate repeating groups; ensure each column contains atomic values (indivisible).
- **Check:**  
All entities (User, Property, Booking, Payment, Review, Message) have atomic attributes â€” no lists or multiple values in a single field.

**âœ… Passes 1NF**

---

### ðŸ”¹ Second Normal Form (2NF)

- **Rule:** Must first be in 1NF. Remove partial dependencies â€” every non-key attribute must depend on the whole primary key.
- **Check:**  
All tables with composite keys are reviewed. However, in this design, most tables use a single-column primary key (UUID). Therefore, no partial dependencies exist.

**âœ… Passes 2NF**

---

### ðŸ”¹ Third Normal Form (3NF)

- **Rule:** Must be in 2NF. Remove transitive dependencies â€” non-key attributes should depend only on the primary key.
- **Check:**  
No transitive dependencies are found. All non-key attributes depend directly on their table's primary key.

**Examples:**
- In the **Booking** table, `total_price`, `start_date`, and `end_date` all depend directly on `booking_id`.
- In **Payment**, `amount` and `payment_method` depend only on `payment_id`.
- No attribute depends on another non-primary key attribute.

**âœ… Passes 3NF**

## âœ… Conclusion

The database schema satisfies the requirements for 3NF. It eliminates redundancy, ensures data integrity, and maintains clear relationships between entities.

## ðŸš€ Notes

No further adjustments were necessary since the schema was designed with normalization in mind from the beginning.
